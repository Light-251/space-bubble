**Space Bubble**
---
Space Bubble is a project inspired by classic games like Space Invaders and Puzzle Bubble, created solely for learning and experimenting with Unity. 
The game is in the early stages of development, focusing on basic mechanics. 
Players aim and shoot bubbles at enemy ships, with a color-matching system that grants higher points when a bubble and an enemy share the same color. 
This project is a work in progress, and its primary goal is to explore Unity's features and capabilities.
